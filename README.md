# TwitPaint

TwitPaint is an absurdly simplistic "paint" web app that pops out emoji grids, like this:

```
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸªğŸŸ§ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ§ğŸŸ§ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

These are designed for posting to Twitter:

- The grid is just under the maximum post size.
- The width/height is optimized for the narrow, portrait nature of most Twitter UIs.
- The color palette is meant to look similar to what Twitter enforces; other sets of emoji have varying shades of color for their large blocks, so posting these to, say, Mastodon or Facebook will look slightly different.

_This is a work in progress._ It does not currently save, load, or do anything except scribble pixels.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- Shift-clicking on the canvas selects the color of the pixel under the cursor as the current pen color.

- Shift-clicking on the palette clears the canvas in taht color.

- There is no undo. (Yet.)
